The solution involves refactoring the CSS to avoid using the `!important` flag and to leverage the natural specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green !important; /* !important only needed here if other rules need to be overridden */
}
```

By removing the `!important` from `.myClass`, the more specific selector `#myElement.myClass` now correctly overrides the others without resorting to `!important`. This makes the CSS more maintainable and easier to understand.
