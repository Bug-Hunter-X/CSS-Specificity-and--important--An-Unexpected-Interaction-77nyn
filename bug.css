The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and how they interact with the `!important` flag:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red !important;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green;
}
```

The expected behavior is that the `#myElement.myClass` rule, being more specific, should override the others.  However, because the `.myClass` rule uses `!important`, it will always override the `#myElement.myClass` rule, even though it's less specific. This can lead to unexpected results and difficulties in debugging.
